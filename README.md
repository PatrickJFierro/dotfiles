# Description
This repository stores the configuration for a lot of the tools I use regularly. Currently,
these configurations come from a mix of both Linux and MacOS systems. In the future I'd
like to make each configuration environment agnostic or segregated by intended
environment with accompanying build scripts for ease of use.
